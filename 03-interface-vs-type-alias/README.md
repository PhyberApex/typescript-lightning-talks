# Interface vs Type Alias

In TypeScript, interfaces provide a way to define the shape of objects by specifying properties and their types, 
enabling type safety and autocompletion in your code. While type aliases can be used similarly, interfaces excel in 
scenarios where you need to define complex object structures, allow for easier merging and extension of object types, 
or implement classes. Understanding when to use an interface vs. a type alias is key to writing more maintainable and 
flexible TypeScript code. This talk will explore the differences, use cases, and best practices for choosing between 
the two.
